           MAXIMUM RATIO OF MATRIX DIAGONAL TO FACTOR DIAGONAL = 1.0E+10 AT ROW NUMBER      3
     User information:
     One, two or three of the statistics will be printed as follows:
     (1) negative terms on factor  diagonal only if they exist; (2) maximum
     ratio only if it exceeds a threshold defined by the parameter MAXRATIO
     (default 1.0E7);  (3) spill rows only if the problem spills.
     Depending on the context, these messages may indicate modeling
     problems. The threshold may be changed with the parameter MAXRATIO,
     however, the user is cautioned against arbitrarily increasing the
     MAXRATIO value just to get the model to run.  The cause of large
     MAXRATIOs should be investigated.
     This message is also generated (though the text is slightly different)
     when a Sturm check is performed during eigenvalue extraction. For this
     case, the message does not generally indicate a modeling problem.
     See the NASTRAN Installation and Operation Instructions for
     a discussion of these statistics.  See also the NASTRAN Numerical
     Methods User's Guide.

     UN COUPLED SOLUTION ALGORITHM USED.
     User information:
     The modal methods use uncoupled solution algorithms, if possible.
     The uncoupled algorithms are considerably more economical than the
     coupled algorithms.  Coupled algorithms are required when any of the
     following effects are present:  transfer functions, DMIG requests
     of the p-type, element damping, and PARAM,G.
     Consider the use of modal damping (TABDMP1 entry) to reduce the cost
     of your analysis.
